  abstract = "While graph-based collaborative filtering recommender systems have
  been introduced several years ago, there are still several shortcomings to
  deal with, the temporal information being one of the most important. The new
  link stream paradigm is aiming at extending graphs for correctly modelling the
  graph dynamics, without losing crucial information. We investigate the impact
  of such link stream features for recommender systems. We design link stream
  features, that capture the intrinsic structure and dynamics of the data. We
  show that such features encode a fine-grained and subtle description of the
  underlying system. We focused on a traditional recommender system context, the
  rating prediction on the MovieLens20M movie dataset and the Goodreads book
  dataset. We input link stream features along with some content-based ones into
  a gradient boosting machine (XGBoost) and show that itoutperforms
  significantly a sole content-based solution. These encouraging results call
  for further exploration of this original modelling and its integration to
  complete state-of-the-art recommender systems algorithms. Link streams and
  graphs, as natural visualizations of recommender systems, may offer more
  interpretability in a time when algorithm transparency is an increasingly
  important topic of discussion. We also hope that these results will sparkle
  interesting discussions in the community about the connections between link
  streams and traditional methods (matrix factorization, deep learning)."
